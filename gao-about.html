      <h1>Conway's Game of Life • About</h1>
      <h3>Principle</h3>
      <p class="big">
        Conway’s Game of Life is a zero-player game with a cellular automaton
        created by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. The game of
        Life is played on an infinite two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells.
        Each cell can be either alive or dead depending on its 8 neighbors. A
        pattern is called a generation and it evolves from applying the rules
        simultaneously to every cell on the game board. One interacts with the
        Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it
        evolves.
      </p>
      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies
          (underpopulation).
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies
          (overpopulation).
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives, unchanged, to
          the next generation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors will come to life.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Origins</h3>
      <p class="big">
        John von Neumann, a renowned mathematician, conceived cellular
        automaton. He failed at creating automatons that could build copies of
        itself. He works on this problem in a purely mathematical way by
        studying how a self-reproduction process can be simulated on a grid
        where each cell can only have a limited number of states. These works
        will be published in his posthumous work Theory of Self-Reproductive
        Automata. He inspired John Conway on the Game of Life. Conways tried to
        simplify von Neumann’s idea. The game was first published on October
        1970. <br /><br />Howard Gardner, a developmental psychologist, wrote:
        <br />"The game made Conway instantly famous, but it also opened up a
        whole new field of mathematical research, the field of cellular
        automata... Because of Life's analogies with the rise, fall and
        alterations of a society of living organisms, it belongs to a growing
        class of what are called 'simulation games' (games that resemble real
        life processes)"
      </p>
      <h3>Simulation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Speed<br />
          You can change the speed of the life simulation and observe a faster
          evolution.
        </li>
        <li>
          CellSize<br />
          You can change cells sizes and create simulation whit a bigger or
          smaller population.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pause/Play<br />
          To pause or play the simulation, you can click on the Play/Pause
          button or you can also hit Space.
        </li>
        <li>
          Random<br />
          To create a new random initial configuration, you can click on the
          Random button.
        </li>
      </ul>
