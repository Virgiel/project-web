      <h3>Principle</h3>
      <p class="big">
        The process of fitness selection starts with the simulation of a
        generation of entities. At the end of a generation (a timeout or the end
        of a task) a new generation is made of the fittest individuals from the
        population. New entities inherit their parent's characteristics. If
        parents have good fitness, their babies will inherit it and have a
        better chance of surviving. This process keeps on iterating and in the
        end, a generation with the fittest individuals will be found.
      </p>
      <p class="big">
        During the inheritance of characteristics, some mutations are applied
        with a low random probability. Mutations occur to create new
        possibilities and find new solutions but a huge mutation rate damage the
        learning rate.
      </p>
      <p class="big">
        Genetic AI can be applied to a search problem. We consider a set of
        solutions for a problem and select the set of best ones out of them.

      <h3>Simulation</h3>
      <ul>
        <h4>Sliders</h4>
        <li>
          Nb Wall <br />
          To define how many obstacles you want the AI to be confronted with.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mutation Rate <br />
          The mutation rate measures the quantity of mutation applied during the
          inheritance of characteristics.
        </li>
        <h4>Buttons</h4>
        <li>
          Pause/Play<br />
          To pause or play the simulation, you can click on the Play/Pause
          button or you can also hit Space.
        </li>
        <li>
          Random<br />
          To create a new random initial configuration, you can click on the
          Random button.
