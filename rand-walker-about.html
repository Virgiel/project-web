      <h1>The Random Walker • About</h1>
      <h3>Principle</h3>
      <p class="big">
        Random walks can explain the observed behaviors of many processes. Its
        random steps are completely decorrelated from each other; this
        fundamental property is called the Markov process, named after the
        mathematician Markov. It intuitively means that at any moment, the
        future of the system depends on its present state, but not on its past,
        even the closest. In other words, the system "loses memory" as it
        evolves over time. The generalization takes us into the realm of
        Randomness.

      <p class="big">
        To simulate the movement of the walker, we used Newton’s second law
        which states that the acceleration is proportional to the force. We can
        note x=x(t) the position at time t. Its velocity v = v(t) is the
        derivative of x and its acceleration a = a(t) is the derivative of v. We
        assume that the force depends only on the position and the velocity. The
        state of the particle at time t is described by X(t) = (x(t), v(t))
        which proves that for any t, the future trajectory can be completely
        specified by the current state.

      <h3>Simulation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bounce/Infinite<br />
          Choose the property of the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nervosity<br />The nervosity is the intensity of random accelerations.
          The more nervous is the walker, the more furious his behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          Velocity<br />The velocity is the maximum velocity the walker can
          reach.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pause/Play<br />
          To pause or play the simulation, you can click on the Play/Pause
          button or you can also hit Space.
